# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The PyCity School District has requested an analysis of the collected standardized test scores (reading and math) and school information from all of the students. Python and Pandas are used to clean up and look through the data for any patterns or points of interest.

## Resources
- Data Source: new_full_student_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Pandas 1.4.2

## Summary
A Jupyter Notebook was established and contains Python scripts to perform the analysis as well as Markdown scripts to describe what is taking place. The notebook file allows the Python program to be broken up into cells for compartmentalization, and Markdown cells can be inserted in between for additional commentary besides the Python comments.

The first section reads through the input csv file and imports the data into a DataFrame. The next section cleans up the data by dealing with any null or duplicated values and adjusting any data columns for recasting into a different type. The third section provides a surface-level summary of the cleaned data. The fourth section does a more detailed analysis into specific parts of the data. The last section aggregates the data.
